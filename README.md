# Blood-Cell-Images-Classification
Project related to the course of Artificial "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" (AN2DL) at POLIMI (polytechnic university of Milan)

## Introduction
This project was developed to solve an image classification problem as part of [First challenge of the course of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (AN2DL)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/airlab-polimi_artificialneuralnetworks-deeplearning-imageclassification-activity-7266783804885803008-4nDc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

## Goal
The challenge was to tackle a complex medical image classification problem: specifically, we had to develop an advanced model of a convolutional neural network capable of correctly identifying and classifying different types of blood cells.
As explained in the [report](/Report.pdf), the main challenge to face was the big difference between the dataset provided for the [training](/Training_set_example.png) (made of  13759 96x96 RGB images (0,255) categorisied into 8 different classes) and the heavily corrupted private [test set](/Test_set_example.png) on which the model’s performance was assessed.

## Results
The model achieved 86% accuracy on private test set

## Final Grade
5.5/5.5 points
